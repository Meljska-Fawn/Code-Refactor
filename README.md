# Code-Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this project was to improve the HTML semantics and accessibility and optimize the CSS stylesheet for the Horiseon webpage.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

You can review the HTML and CSS using Chrome DevTools. You can open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see the use of semantic tags in the html and the minimization of redundancy in the CSS.
